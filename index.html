  <p>HTML is the standard markup language for documents designed to be
  displayed in a web browser. It can be assisted by technologies such as Cascading
  Style Sheets (CSS) and scripting languages such as JavaScript.</p>
  <p>The first version of HTML was suggested by Tim Berners-Lee (a famous person
    and a genius respected by everyone who works online and specialises in
    any Internet-related things). It happened in 1990 and 1991, but it wasnâ€™t
    until 1995 that HTML was officially recognised as a standard to be supported
    by browsers and other web software. That was HTML 2.0. Currently, the most popular
    standard is HTML 4.01 (published in 1999), and webmasters are already waiting impatiently
    for HTML 5.0, which promises to give them a lot of new tools that will make web pages
    still more elaborate and attractive</p>
    <p>Like everything in the world, HTML develops continuously, and, as the browsers become more
      sophisticated and support published standards better, webmasters change their approach to
       how they use HTML.</p>

  <p>Web pages can be created and modified by using professional HTML editors.
    However, for learning HTML we recommend a simple text editor like Notepad (PC)
    or TextEdit (Mac). We believe using a simple text editor is a good way to learn HTML.
    Follow the four steps below to create your first web page with Notepad or TextEdit.</p>

    <p>Notepad (PC): Windows 8 or later</p>
    <p>TextEdit (Mac)</p>

    <p>All HTML documents must start with a document type declaration: !DOCTYPE html</p>
    <p>HTML headings are defined with the h1 to h6 tags </p>
    <p>HTML paragraphs are defined with the p tag </p>
    <p>HTML links are defined with the a tag </p>
</section>

<section class="main-section" id="Elements">
    <header>Elements</header><code></code>
    <p>An HTML element usually consists of a start tag and end tag, with the
      content inserted in between</p>

    <p>TIP : HTML elements with no content are called empty elements.
      Empty elements do not have an end tag, such as the br element (which indicates a line break).</p>
</section>

<section class="main-section" id="Attributes">
    <header>Attributes</header><code></code>
    <p>Elements in HTML have attributes; these are additional values that configure the elements
      or adjust their behavior in various ways to meet the criteria the users want.</p>

    <p>Also, some attributes are required for certain elements. For instance, an img
    tag must contain a src and alt attributes. </p>
